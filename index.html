      //    This is the third or fourth main build of this schedule. This project was my way
      //  to learn the full stack of web application development. It is Javascript-based,
      //  with minimal PHP backend to interface with the MySQL databases. The main priority
      //  with this project is to keep strict separation of jobs - the PHP simply maintains
      //  the database, the javascript processes all the data, the CSS and HTML mark it up
      //  for display. I avoided inline methods to maintain semantic discretion between
      //  markup and code. 

      //    Within the JS, the goal was, obviously, speed - but not in terms of page load time,
      //  which is a trivial concern, but in the actual usage. Accuracy and completion are
      //  the main priorities, and therefore it seemed paramount to minimize clicks. Currently
      //  the system in place is a simple spreadsheet, and I thought a similar layout (tabbing
      //  through each field) was the simplest/quickest approach. Since the spreadsheet was 
      //  basically the exact method I was striving for, I had to answer the question: why
      //  bother creating a new program? Short answer: excuse to have a project to learn. But
      //  the Google spreadsheet program is bloated for our purposes, it's slow and requires
      //  manually creating pre-formatted sections to enter in entries, and it gets sloppy
      //  quickly.
